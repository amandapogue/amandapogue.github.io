# amandapogue.github.io

I've copied all of the files from my BCS bage to github. Eventually I'll 
switch to using github as my sole / primary website, as it permits for better 
version control, and it is easier to update from the commandline.

This website includes:
* a css from and HTML5UP template
* some documents, which includes the most recent form of my CV
* some images used on my personal website
