      <h2>Abstract Nouns and Countability</h2>      <p>Despite the vast mass/count literature, determining why an abstract        noun is countable ('arrival') or uncountable ('happiness') remains        largely unexplored territory. This talk examines the countability of        abstract nouns through a series of empirical studies, ultimately arguing        against proposals relating a noun's countability status to some facet of        its derivational history, and instead arguing for aligning the        countability of a particular noun occurrence with its meaning. </p>      <p>The influential proposal of Mourelatos (1978) relates countability to        aktionsart: nouns derived from states/activities are uncountable, while        those derived from accomplishments/achievements are countable. I        examined this proposal by constructing a database of 3100 deverbal nouns        which contains countability classification and the verbal source's        aktionsart. Although nouns derived from statives do correlate with        non-countable nouns, overall a vast number of counter-examples and        frequent polysemy demonstrate that this explanation is too        coarse-grained. A second study establishes similar results for        Grimshaw's (1990) proposed correlation between types of derived nouns        and countability, wherein Simple Event Nominals ('race', 'trip') and        Result Nominals ('exam') are countable and Complex Event Nominals        (CENs), deverbal nouns possessing arguments are non-countable. A broad        corpus study found a large number of counter-examples and, more        generally, whether a given nominal was a CEN or not had no effect on its        rate of occurrence in the plural. </p>      <p>I conclude with a set of smaller corpus studies of particular semantic        domains (e.g. psych-nouns ('irritation'), mental properties        ('intelligence'), behavioral properties ('kindness')) demonstrating that        the countability of abstract nouns is determined in different ways        depending on the semantic domain at issue. The designation of the noun        determines its countability status, but this is influenced by a complex        set of factors including lexicalization patterns, ontological contrasts,        referential status, and world knowledge. Additionally, while there is        frequent polysemy between countable and non-countable construals, this        too is principled, depending on the particularities of the semantic        domain. </p>
